This is just a test for a strange encoding method that came to me. It didn't really work, but I'm uploading it anyway. It takes an input time, or whatever you want to call it, and a string input, which it converts to an ASCII code. It than shifts the first character and the second, second and third, third and forth, and so on for the number of time. It uses three args when you run it, encode/decode, input and time.

## Usage:
If you want to use it, I recommend the library because it can output it in a form that is decodable (decoding ???? won't give you your encoded text back), but if you really want to use the command-line version, heres the command: `scipher-2.jar encode/decode input text here SHIFT_KEY` (SHIFT_KEY is a number)

## BUGS:
