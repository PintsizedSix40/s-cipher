This is just a test for a strange encoding method that came to me. It didn't really work, but I'm uploading it anyway. It takes an input time, or whatever you want to call it, and a string input, which it converts to a hex. It than shifts the first character and the second, second and third, third and forth, and so on for the number of time. It uses two args when you run it, input and time. I also don't know how to decode it.

BUGS:
- Unable to decode.
- Max time is two times your input excluding spaces (I'll fix this later).
